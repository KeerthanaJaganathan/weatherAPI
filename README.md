# weatherAPI
API testing for weather
I have created two feature 
1. weatherAPI.feature . - this is to test state code is correctly diplayed in the response
2. WeatherAPI2.feature  - this is to test the performance of the API, I have given the for loop for the API to run 10 times. IO hav capturedd the start time of the system and then once the API executon is completed I have captured the end time of the system and then find the difference to find the performance of the API.
3. I have used MAC hence the chromedriver used is for MAC.
